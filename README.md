# Welcome to Patrizia Paggioâ€™s home page

My current research interests are in the areas of multimodal communication, multimodal corpora and the interface between spoken language and gestural behaviour. I also have expertise in machine translation, grammar development and content-based querying.

Besides beging a senior researcher at the University of Copenhagen, I am also a full professor at the University of Malta, Institute of Linguistics and Language Technology, see [my profile at UM](https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/patriziapaggio).
